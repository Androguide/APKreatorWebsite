                APKreator is perfect for YouTubers wanting to increase their visibility, credibility and amount of
                subscribers/viewers.<br/>
                We have had some great feedback from our clients running a YouTube channel, where they saw a
                visibile increase in both views and subscriptions after publishing and announcing their APKreator
                app.<br/>
            </p>

            <p class="ng-binding aleo">
                As we all know, making a living off of YouTube is not an easy task.<br/>
                With APKreator, you can make money with your content no matter whether you are a YouTube Partner or not.
                <br/><br/>
                How, you ask? With the help of our AdSense integration your app can, if you wish to, generate income
                through advertising banners
                placed inside it (<i>AdSense integration is not available for FREE & STARTER plans</i>).
                <br/><br/>
                This way, When your users view or click an add, the income generated goes directly to you, cutting-out
                the middle-man.
                <br/>
                This can provide a nice complementary income to YouTube Partners, or a good kickstart for channels who
                are
                not already YouTube Partners.
